User Accessing the Website:
A user types "www.foobar.com" into their web browser.
The browser sends a request to the DNS server to resolve "www.foobar.com" to an IP address.
The DNS server responds with the IP address "8.8.8.8".
The user's browser sends a request to the server at IP address "8.8.8.8".

Server:
Definition: A server is a powerful computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other computers over a network.
Role: Hosts the entire web application including the web server, application server, and database.

Domain Name:
Role: A domain name is a human-readable address used to access a website. It is easier to remember than an IP address.
DNS Record: The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is a CNAME (Canonical Name) or A (Address) record that maps to the IP address of the server.

Web Server (Nginx):
Role: Handles incoming HTTP requests from users. It serves static content (like HTML, CSS, JS) and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server:
Role: Runs the application code (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) that processes requests and generates dynamic content. It handles the business logic of the application.

Database (MySQL):
Role: Stores and manages application data. It processes queries from the application server to retrieve or update data.

Communication:
Protocol: The server communicates with the user's computer using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. HTTPS ensures that data is encrypted during transmission.

Issues with This Infrastructure

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
If the single server fails, the entire website becomes unavailable.

Downtime During Maintenance:
When deploying new code or performing maintenance, the web server may need to be restarted, causing temporary downtime.

Scalability:
The infrastructure cannot handle high traffic volumes as it is limited to a single server. This can lead to performance degradation or outages under heavy load.
